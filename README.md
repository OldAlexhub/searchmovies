# Movie Search Application (Frontend)

This is the frontend for the Movie Search Application, built using **ReactJS**. The application allows users to search for movies by entering partial plot descriptions or specific keywords. The app communicates with a backend (Node.js + Python) to retrieve search results.

## Features

- **Movie Search by Plot**: Users can input plot details, and the app will search for relevant movies using AI.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Search**: As soon as the user submits the plot, the backend fetches movie results using AI-powered search.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and lifecycle (e.g., `useState`).
